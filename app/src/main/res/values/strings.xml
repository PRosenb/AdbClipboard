        This simple app is for developers only.
        \n
        \nIt allows you to read and write the clipboard of the Android device using
        ADB commands.
        \nSee also scripts in the Github repository:
        \ngithub.com/PRosenb/AdbClipboard
        \n
        \nNo need to keep this screen open. The app will be started in the background when you execute the ADB command.
        \n
        \nRead clipboard:
        \nadb shell am broadcast -n \"ch.pete.adbclipboard/.ReadReceiver\"
        \n
        \nIt returns the content of the clipboard in the "data" element.
        \n
        \nWrite clipboard:
        \nadb shell am broadcast -n \"ch.pete.adbclipboard/.WriteReceiver\" -e text \"urlEncodedString\"
        \n
        \nIf you use spaces, the string needs to be url encoded.
